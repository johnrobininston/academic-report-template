# Academic-report-template Format

## Installing

To use this template use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
quarto use template johnrobininston/academic-report-template
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

## Using

The template document has examples of all features I have used when writing my reports.  Further documentation on the full feature set can be found in the typst documentation at [https://typst.app/docs/](https://typst.app/docs/).
