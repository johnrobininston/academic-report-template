  abstract = {.In this paper we study a time-inconsistent portfolio optimization problem for competitive agents with CARA utilities and nonexponential discounting. The utility of each agent depends on their own wealth and consumption as well as the relative wealth and consumption of the competitors. Due to the presence of a nonexponential discount factor, each agent's optimal strategy becomes time-inconsistent. In order to resolve time-inconsistency, each agent makes a decision in a sophisticated way, choosing an open-loop equilibrium strategy in response to the strategies of all the other agents. We construct explicit solutions for the -agent games and the corresponding mean field games (MFGs) where the limit of the former yields the latter. This solution is unique in a special class of equilibria.},

  abstract = {Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.},

Interactions are of mean field type in the sense that the demand faced by a producer is affected by the others through their average price or quantity. Motivated by energy or consumer goods markets, we consider the setting of a dynamic game with uncertain market demand, and under the constraint of finite supplies (or exhaustible resources). The continuum game is characterized by a coupled system of partial differential equations: a backward Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman partial differential equation (PDE) for the value function, and a forward Kolmogorov PDE for the density of players. Asymptotic approximation enables us to deduce certain qualitative features of the game in the limit of small competition. The equilibrium of the game is further studied using numerical solutions, which become very tractable by considering the tail distribution function instead of the density itself. This also allows us to consider Dirac delta distributions to use the continuum game to mimic finite \$\$N\$\$-player nonzero-sum differential games, the advantage being having to deal with two coupled PDEs instead of \$\$N\$\$. We find that, in accordance with the two-player game, a large degree of competitive interaction causes firms to slow down production. The continuum system can therefore be used qualitative as an approximation to even small player dynamic games.},

  abstract = {The Central Valley of California is one of the most prolific agricultural regions in the world. Agriculture is reliant on the conjunctive use of surface-water and groundwater. The lack of available surface-water and land-use changes have led to pumping-induced groundwater-level and storage declines, land subsidence, changes to streamflow and the environment, and the degradation of water quality. As a result, in part, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) was developed. An examination of the components of SGMA and contextualizing regional model applications within the SGMA framework was undertaken to better understand and quantify many of the components of SGMA. Specifically, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) updated the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) to assess hydrologic system responses to climatic variation, surface-water availability, land-use changes, and groundwater pumping. MODFLOW-OWHM has been enhanced to simulate the timing of land subsidence and attribute its inelastic and elastic portions. In addition to extending CVHM through 2019, the new version, CVHM2, includes several enhancements as follows: managed aquifer recharge (MAR), pumping with multi-aquifer wells, inflows from ungauged watersheds, and more detailed water-balance subregions, streamflow network, diversions, tile drains, land use, aquifer properties, and groundwater level and land subsidence observations. Combined with historical approximations, CVHM2 estimates approximately 158 km3 of storage loss in the Central Valley from pre-development to 2019. About 15\% of the total storage loss is permanent loss of storage from subsidence that has caused damage to infrastructure. Climate extremes will likely complicate the efforts of water managers to store more water in the ground. CVHM2 can provide data in the form of aggregated input datasets, simulate climatic variations and changes, land-use changes or water management scenarios, and resulting changes in groundwater levels, storage, and land subsidence to assist decision-makers in the conjunctive management of water supplies.},

The resulted algorithm can solve large \$N\$-player games for which conventional numerical methods would suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Multiple numerical examples involving identical or heterogeneous agents, with risk-neutral or risk-sensitive objectives, are tested to validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in large group games. Even for a fifty-player game with the presence of common noise, the proposed algorithm still finds the approximate Nash equilibrium accurately, which, to our best knowledge, is difficult to achieve by other numerical algorithms.},

Specifically at each stage, we propose the strategy of letting individual player optimize her own payoff subject to the other players' previous actions, equivalent to solve \$N\$ decoupled stochastic control optimization problems, which are approximated by DNNs.

  abstract = {Drought is a frequent and costly natural disaster in California, with major negative impacts on agricultural production and water resource availability, particularly groundwater. This study investigated the performance of applying different machine learning approaches to predicting the U.S. Drought Monitor classification in California. Four approaches were used: a convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest, XGBoost, and long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, and compared to a baseline persistence model. We evaluated the models' performance in predicting severe drought (USDM drought category D2 or higher) using a macro F1 binary classification metric. The LSTM model emerged as the top performer, followed by XGBoost, CNN, and random forest. Further evaluation of our results at the county level suggested that the LSTM model would perform best in counties with more consistent drought patterns and where severe drought was more common, and the LSTM model would perform worse where drought scores increased rapidly. Utilizing 30 weeks of historical data, the LSTM model successfully forecasted drought scores for a 12-week period with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.33, equivalent to less than half a drought category on a scale of 0 to 5. Additionally, the LSTM achieved a macro F1 score of 0.9, indicating high accuracy in binary classification for severe drought conditions. Evaluation of different window and future horizon sizes in weeks suggested that at least 24 weeks of data would result in the best performance, with best performance for shorter horizon sizes, particularly less than eight weeks.},

Miners compete against each other for mining rewards by increasing their computational power. This leads to a novel mean field game of jump intensity control, which we solve explicitly for miners maximizing exponential utility and handle numerically in the case of miners with power utilities. We show that the heterogeneity of their initial wealth distribution leads to greater imbalance of the reward distribution, and increased wealth heterogeneity over time, or a ``rich get richer'' effect. This concentration phenomenon is aggravated by a higher Bitcoin mining reward and reduced by competition. Additionally, an advantaged miner with cost advantages such as access to cheaper electricity, contributes a significant amount of computational power in equilibrium, unaffected by competition from less efficient miners. Hence, cost efficiency can also result in the type of centralization seen among miners of cryptocurrencies. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance. Funding: A. M.

  abstract = {After years of crippling drought, California experienced a barrage of intense atmospheric river storms starting from late 2022 and continuing into early 2023 after so many years of extensive drought. This resulted in extensive flooding across the northern and central parts of the state. Major urban centers like San Francisco and Sacramento saw their wettest January on record, with damage to infrastructure and thousands evacuated in flooded areas. Southern California also saw higher than average rainfall. The extensive rainfall provided much-needed relief from the recent drought, helping to replenish reservoirs and groundwater basins, but also causing lot of catastrophic events due to California's insufficient flood control infrastructure. Decades of underfunding and lack of coordination have left dams, levees, and urban flood control channels unable to handle increased precipitation, putting communities at risk. Historically, California has experienced periodic droughts, where precipitation falls well below average for multiple seasons or years. Significant droughts were observed in the past century such as in the years 1976--1977, 1987--1992, and 2012--2016. The most recent drought from 2012--2022 ranked as one of the most severe and most prolonged droughts on record in California. Although the 2023 storms helped in recovery from drought conditions, California must bolster its flood control systems and water storage capabilities. The state must prepare for a future where climate change drives intense precipitation alongside more intense droughts. Sustainable infrastructure and coordinated management will be vital for withstanding increased hydrological extremes. This article examines the rainfall extremes of 2023 within the context of California's drought history and makes recommendations for long-term water security to overcome increased climate variability.},

This paper examines conjunctive water management for agriculture using hydro-economic optimization modeling. The analysis is integrated across two timescales: a two-stage stochastic decadal model for managing annual and perennial crops spanning dry and wet years and a far-horizon dynamic program embedding the decadal model into a longer groundwater policy setting. The modeling loosely represents California's San Joaquin Valley and has insights for many irrigated arid and semi-arid regions relying on groundwater with variable annual hydrology. Results show how conjunctive water management can stabilize crop decisions and improve agricultural profitability across different water years by pumping more in dry years and increasing recharging groundwater in wetter years. Using groundwater as a buffer for droughts allows growing more higher-value perennial crops, which maximizes profit even with water-scarce conditions. Nevertheless, ending overdraft in basins with declining groundwater for profit-maximizing farming reduces annual crops to maintain more profitable perennial crops through droughts. Results are affected by economic discount rates and future climates. Operating and opportunity costs from forgone annual crops can reduce aquifer recharge early in regulatory periods.},
